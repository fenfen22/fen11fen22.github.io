I am just setting up feature posts so give it some time. For now the syntax in the template head is how you change the posts images and ID to use in feature displays on the site. You can change the summary in the header template and it will display in your feature card on the front. You can also include images here and they will not display. Take a look at the [Example Hero]() post for example of how to use them in a post. Thumbnails need to be 250x200 I may change it so the CSS controls that in the future.
